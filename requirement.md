* [Users]

The target users are diverse individuals who hope to commercialize their products, services and knowledge in the community network, and most the users maybe at the bottom of the pyramid. The web application will be used in Canada, the USA and Brazil in the first stage. Thus, most users will have basic experiences using online transaction system. 

### 1.2 Product Scope

The Ingenuity Incubator web application is a platform where people can trade their products and service including knowledge using virtual community currency. Users can create their lists of product or service details in different categories and search the items they needs. The software will record the transaction history and details for the each user and keep track of the balance for currency, products and services.  The Ingenuity Incubator web application is a part of the Reframery Information System, which aims to integrate the virtural currency based on blockchain and the marketplace application.  

This web application will help the diverse individuals to start their commercial actvities in their social network and improve their personal life. People who have competence and creativity will engage in the community well and make their potential contribution to local economies. Thus, it will also plays a positive impact on the community economies during the global economic stagnation. What the web application can do will help the Reframery team to fulfill their mission. The Reframery team can improved their consulting and training service for their client based on the data in the information system. 

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations

### 1.4 References
List any other documents or Web addresses to which this SRS refers. These may include user interface style guides, contracts, standards, system requirements specifications, use case documents, or a vision and scope document. Provide enough information so that the reader could access a copy of each reference, including title, author, version number, date, and source or location.

### 1.5 Document Overview
Describe what the rest of the document contains and how it is organized.

## 2. Product Overview
> This section should describe the general factors that affect the product and its requirements. This section does not state specific requirements. Instead, it provides a background for those requirements, which are defined in detail in Section 3, and makes them easier to understand.

### 2.1 Product Perspective
Describe the context and origin of the product being specified in this SRS. For example, state whether this product is a follow-on member of a product family, a replacement for certain existing systems, or a new, self-contained product. If the SRS defines a component of a larger system, relate the requirements of the larger system to the functionality of this software and identify interfaces between the two. A simple diagram that shows the major components of the overall system, subsystem interconnections, and external interfaces can be helpful.

### 2.2 Product Functions
Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary (such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram or object class diagram, is often effective.

### 2.3 Product Constraints
This subsection should provide a general description of any other items that will limit the developer’s options. These may include:  

* Interfaces to users, other applications or hardware.  
* Quality of service constraints.  
* Standards compliance.  
* Constraints around design or implementation.

### 2.4 User Characteristics
Identify the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product. User classes may be differentiated based on frequency of use, subset of product functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels, educational level, or experience. Describe the pertinent characteristics of each user class. Certain requirements may pertain only to certain user classes. Distinguish the most important user classes for this product from those who are less important to satisfy.

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).

### 2.6 Apportioning of Requirements
Apportion the software requirements to software elements. For requirements that will require implementation over multiple software elements, or when allocation to a software element is initially undefined, this should be so stated. A cross reference table by function and software element should be used to summarize the apportioning.

Identify requirements that may be delayed until future versions of the system (e.g., blocks and/or increments).

## 3. Requirements
> This section specifies the software product's requirements. Specify all of the software requirements to a level of detail sufficient to enable designers to design a software system to satisfy those requirements, and to enable testers to test that the software system satisfies those requirements.

> The specific requirements should:
* Be uniquely identifiable.
* State the subject of the requirement (e.g., system, software, etc.) and what shall be done.
* Optionally state the conditions and constraints, if any.
* Describe every input (stimulus) into the software system, every output (response) from the software system, and all functions performed by the software system in response to an input or in support of an output.
* Be verifiable (e.g., the requirement realization can be proven to the customer's satisfaction)
* Conform to agreed upon syntax, keywords, and terms.

### 3.1 External Interfaces
> This subsection defines all the inputs into and outputs requirements of the software system. Each interface defined may include the following content:
* Name of item
* Source of input or destination of output
* Valid range, accuracy, and/or tolerance
* Units of measure
* Timing
* Relationships to other inputs/outputs
* Screen formats/organization
* Window formats/organization
* Data formats
* Command formats
* End messages
